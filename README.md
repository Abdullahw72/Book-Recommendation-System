# Book Recommendation System
Book Recommendation System with Dual Approach

This study suggests a collaborative filtering and interest-based book recommendation
system. Cosine similarity is used in collaborative filtering for analysis, and the interest degree
employs the book's fundamental characteristics as a measuring index. It has been determined
that the approach suggested in this work has a satisfactory convergence result after evaluating
the statistical data of the library of Wuxi Vocational College of Science and Technology for
many years utilising MAE and RMSE two measurement indicators for experimental analysis.
In order to get superior convergence outcomes, the following phase aims to simultaneously
improve the measurement indicators and the collaborative filtering method.

 * BRS.ipynb shows the Collaborative and Hybrid Recommenders using 10 different types of Approaches.


* Book_recommender.ipynb shows a Machine Learning Oriented Approach.

## Installation

* Unzip Dataset in to the project folder



* Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
pip install virtualenv
python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
<virtual-environment-name>\Scripts\activate

```
* Install the requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r /requirements.txt
```
* (Optional) If you want to run the .ipynb file on Jupyter Notebook, run the following command in it first to access the Virtual Environment:

```
ipython kernel install --user --name=<virtual-environment-name>
```

After this, just run the notebook file. 

For more information, refer to the attached Project Report.
